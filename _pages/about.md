# Welcome! 
I am now a senior student at [China University of Geosciences (Beijing)](www.cugb.edu.cn). Fortunately, I am under the guidance of Professor [Li Li](https://scholar.cugb.edu.cn/scholar/scholarDetail/620.shtml) from the School of Economics and Management. During my junior year, I published three SCI papers.

Since July 2024, I have been working as a daily intern at [TAL Education Group](https://www.100tal.com/) in Beijing, responsible for business data analysis and AI-related tasks, under the supervision of Ms. Han Zhou.

My research interests include energy economics, environmental economics, and machine learning. **Presently, I am deeply involved in specific projects related to new productive forces for my undergraduate thesis research**.

You can find my resume here: [Cheng Zhang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf). If you are interested in my work, please feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:zorange411@gmail.com).

I hope this helps you better understand my background and research directions.
